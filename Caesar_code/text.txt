Coding can be addictive, and this means you need to know when to step away from the screen. Yes, working on lines of 
code and bugs will help you learn faster, but there is such thing as burnout. You want to keep your mind fresh so you 
can tackle new problems with confidence, so know when it’s time to call it a day.

It’s easy to spiral into negativity if you’ve been struggling with a bug or error for a few hours. Let your mind refresh. 
Turn off your computer and do something else. Go outside, take a walk, or even just scroll through your phone. Anything 
that gives you mind a much-needed break.

Programmers need thick skin. Things will go wrong. Sometimes, those things are out of your control. As a programmer, 
you’re a problem solver. It’s okay if you need a break to clear your head for those problems, and it’s okay if you need 
to walk away sometimes.
